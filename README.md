See the Dynamic Pathfinder tool HERE https://austin-t.github.io/Pathfinder/.

This is a visualization tool for both weighted and unweighted pathfinding algorithms.
The tool enables a user to create walls and weights on a two dimensional grid, either
manually or by randomly generating a pattern. The pathfinding algorithms will explore
nodes in the graph in variable ways as it interactes with the walls and weights. After
seeing a live animation of the pathfinding algorithm, drag either the start node or the
target node to automatically recompute the algorithm.

Happy coding!
